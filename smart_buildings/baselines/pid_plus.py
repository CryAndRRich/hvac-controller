"""A chain of controllers built on `pid`, each adding one idea to the last.

`pid` already idles per air handler while its zones are in band, and drives
each VAV damper and reheat valve from that zone's own temperature. These
subclasses address what a plant-level rule-based controller still leaves on the
table. Each is a base class for the next, so the chain reads as a sequence of
independent improvements.

  PIDWorstZonePolicy   The AHU loop runs on the *average* zone temperature of
                       the zones it serves, but the comfort penalty is
                       unbounded in the *worst* zone's deviation. An air
                       handler can therefore sit idle, perfectly average, while
                       one zone under it runs away and dominates the episode.
                       This drives the loop from the worst zone instead.

  PIDEconomizerPolicy  Modulates recirculation rather than pinning it at the
                       ventilation cap. Cooling with return air while the
                       outside air is colder than the space is paid-for cooling
                       that the weather was offering free. The mix is
                       proportional: it blends outside and return air to land
                       on the supply air target, so very cold outside air
                       results in less of it being drawn, not none.

  PIDProportionalReheatPolicy
                       Modulates the reheat valve rather than switching it.

  PIDWaterResetPolicy  Resets the hot water supply temperature against demand,
                       so the loop is not held at its maximum whenever any
                       single zone calls for heat.

One further refinement runs through the chain: the comfort band is read from
each zone's own setpoint sensors instead of being rebuilt from the hour of day.
The reward measures deviation from those sensors, so where a reconstructed band
disagrees with them the controller either conditions a zone the reward already
considers comfortable, which is cost for no benefit, or neglects one it does
not. Reading the sensors makes the controller and the scorer agree on where the
edge is.

class PIDWaterResetPolicy(PIDProportionalReheatPolicy):
    """Proportional reheat valve AND the hot water temperature reset on demand.

    Both halves are needed, and each is weak alone.

    The hot water loop is building-wide. A demand reset on its own is therefore
    set by the coldest zone in the building: one zone several kelvin below its
    band drives the loop to its maximum, and every satisfied zone still sitting
    at its damper floor receives that very hot water anyway. A proportional
    valve on its own helps, but it is throttling air that is still far hotter
    than the zone needs.

    Together the loop runs only as hot as the worst zone requires, and each
    valve opens only as far as its own zone requires.

    WHY A RESET RATHER THAN A FIXED TEMPERATURE

    Pinning the loop low is not a solution: a hard winter climate genuinely
    needs the full water temperature. So the loop is reset against the demand
    that actually exists, linearly, saturating at RESET_FULL_K below the band.

    PROPORTIONAL DROOP, AND THE SATURATION TERM

    A purely proportional reset has a steady-state offset, and here that offset
    is the whole error: the loop only commands full water when the mean zone is
    already RESET_FULL_K short. In a climate that genuinely needs full water the
    controller therefore settles on a building that is RESET_FULL_K cold, which
    is precisely where it must not be.

    An integrator is the textbook remedy and is the wrong one here. Raising the
    water temperature satisfies the bulk of the zones sooner, so the air handler
    idles sooner, so an outlier zone loses its airflow and drifts further. Since
    the comfort penalty is unbounded in the worst zone, widening the spread at
    both ends is the worst available outcome. The mechanism is left in the class
    with its gain defaulting to zero, so the next reader does not rebuild it.

    Outdoor-air reset is the other textbook answer. It works, but the crossover
    temperature it needs differs sharply between cold climates, and fitting that
    ramp to the scenarios in hand would not transfer to unseen buildings.

    Instead the reset takes the greater of two signals:

      demand      how far the mean zone is below its band
      saturation  how hard the air side is already working

    The second answers a different question -- not "is the building cold" but
    "has the air side run out of authority". In a severe winter every handler
    sits at full effort all episode, the air side has nothing left to give, and
    the only remaining lever is hotter water. In a mild climate effort is near
    zero for most of the day, so the loop stays cool and follows only the
    morning ramp. Reading saturation off the plant itself is what makes this
    transfer, where a fitted outdoor-air curve would not.

        Two terms, and the larger wins.

        The DEMAND term is the mean zone shortfall over the proportional band,
        as described above.

        The SATURATION term is the mean heating effort the AHU loop is already
        commanding. It answers a different question: not "how cold is the
        building" but "has the air side run out of authority". Those come apart
        exactly where the demand term fails. In deep cold every handler sits at
        full effort all episode, so the air side has nothing left to give and
        the only remaining lever is hotter water. In shoulder weather effort is
        near zero most of the day, so the loop stays cool and only follows the
        morning ramp.

        Why this and not an integrator, and not outdoor-air reset:

        * An integrator removes the droop in cold weather but widens the zone
          spread at both ends. Hotter water satisfies the bulk of the zones
          sooner, so the handler idles sooner, so an outlier zone loses its
          airflow and drifts further. Since the comfort penalty is unbounded in
          the worst zone, that trade is a loss.
        * Outdoor-air reset is the textbook answer and does work, but the
          crossover temperature it needs differs sharply between cold climates.
          Fitting that ramp to the scenarios in hand would not transfer to
          unseen buildings. The saturation term reads the same distinction off
          the plant itself.

        Note the saturation term also pays for itself on energy, which was not
        the reason for adding it. In the coldest scenarios, cool water costs
        MORE than hot: the coil cannot deliver, so the fan sits at full static
        pressure all episode moving air that is not warm enough. Per unit of
        heat delivered, hotter water trades fan electricity for boiler gas, and
        electricity is the dearer of the two in both price and carbon.
