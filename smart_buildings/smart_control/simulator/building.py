    The floor plan generator honours min_room_size when it splits the BSP tree,
    but the composite shape mask is applied afterwards and clips any leaf that
    straddles its boundary. What survives is a connected component whose size
    nothing ever checked, and it can be a sliver: building_train_5 and
    building_train_7 share min_room_size 25 and composite_coverage 0.67 and
    come out with smallest zones of 9.36 m2 and 50.88 m2. So the realised
    minimum is not settable from the floor plan parameters and has to be
    measured here, after the zones exist.

    A sliver is not merely unrealistic, it diverges. Occupant heat is assigned
    per zone -- zone_assignment occupants at occupant_sensible_heat_w each --
    while internal gains, the VAV's share of airflow, and the mean temperature
    its thermostat reads are all weighted by floor area. So a small zone takes
    a full zone's worth of occupant heat into very little air while contributing
    almost nothing to the signal the loop controlling it can see. Measured on
    building_train_8 before this check existed: room_1, 9.88 m2 and 35,746 J/K,
    reached 149.2 C over a scored episode, and the 9.36 m2 room_23 of
    building_train_5 reached 141.4 C. Nothing bounded them but the solver's own
    np.clip(temp, 150, 500), which tops out near 227 C.

    It also corrupts the reward rather than just the trajectory. Comfort is 0.6
    of the reward, its shortfall is unbounded beyond the deviation reference,
    and productivity is summed over zones weighted by each zone's own occupancy
    rather than its area. A zone 167 K outside the band scores a productivity
    factor near -1050 against about +1 for an in-band zone, with the same
    weight, so one sliver decides the scenario.

    Twenty square metres is the floor because the runaway stops by about 17 m2
    (roughly 60,000 J/K) in measurement, and because 20 m2 is 10 m2 per
    occupant at the shipped zone_assignment of 2, an ordinary office density.
    That is what makes the per-zone occupancy assumption sound, which is why
    this is a geometry check and not a change to the occupancy model.
